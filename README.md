# Continuous-Diffusion-Language-Model

## Overview
This project explores the application of diffusion-based modeling concepts to language data. The objective is to understand how diffusion processes can be adapted for sequence modeling tasks and how textual representations evolve through iterative noise addition and denoising steps.

The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on experimentation, visualization, and analysis rather than large-scale training.

## Concept
Diffusion models are generative models that learn to gradually transform noise into structured data. In this project, diffusion principles are applied to continuous representations of text, enabling experimentation with language modeling using iterative denoising techniques.

## Implementation
- Text data converted into continuous vector representations
- Forward diffusion process implemented by progressively adding noise
- Reverse process modeled to recover structured representations
- Model behavior analyzed across multiple diffusion steps
- Experiments performed within a controlled notebook environment

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of diffusion-based generative modeling concepts
- Exposure to alternative approaches for language modeling
- Practical experience with iterative noise-based training procedures
- Improved intuition for continuous representations of textual data
